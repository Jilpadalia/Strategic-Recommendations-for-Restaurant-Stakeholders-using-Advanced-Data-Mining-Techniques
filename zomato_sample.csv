Quick service and good options for munching - ambience and music are good . Centrally located place .. not very heavy on pocket .'), ('Rated 3.0', ""RATED\n  They didn't have any of the exotic beers on the menu which was quite a bummer. It was a Friday night! If you don't stock it then, when then? The one dish that really stood out was the mushroom and cheese bruschetta. Real yum! The music is just so-so and the ambience is nothing to write home about either. All in all, an average night out experience.""), ('Rated 5.0', ""RATED\n  There are two restaurants here, ground floor being gorilla barfare while first floor is local! Many doesn't know it! This one is seriously far better than local! Was stunned initially with the ambience! Then the huge menu card! And then finally the food! The taste is fabulous!! Must try is the cheese garlic bread! It'll show you what paradise is! The staff are very very friendly! It has gold on drinks! Prices are affordable! Overall.. it's a must try!! U'll love it!\n\nbakasuraforever.in""), ('Rated 5.0', 'RATED\n  Simple but elegant place. Very very humble and courteous staff! A bit of jungle like atmosphere.
